# Email Sender Console Application

## Overview

The **Email Sender Console Application** is a C# project designed to explore and learn about C# programming and .NET technologies. This console-based application allows users to send emails with features such as scheduling and attachments.

## Purpose

The **Email Sender Console Application** was inspired by a sophisticated email sender system I encountered while working with a banking web application in Indonesia. Although the system I observed was built using Java, I was fascinated by its ability to handle critical communications, such as transaction alerts and important notifications.

Driven by a desire to deepen my understanding of C# and .NET technologies, I decided to create a similar application using C#. This project represents my personal journey to explore and master C#, while implementing features that I admired in the Java-based system I worked with.

By developing this console-based email sender application, I aimed to translate the concepts and functionalities of the original system into C#, thereby gaining hands-on experience with email handling, scheduling, and HTML templating in a .NET environment.
## Lessons Learned

Building this project provided valuable insights into handling email operations and scheduling tasks programmatically. I gained practical experience with the MailKit library for sending emails, as well as implementing scheduling functionality to manage email delivery times effectively.

A significant lesson learned was the importance of **separation of concerns** in application design. By organizing the code into distinct components for email handling, scheduling, and user interaction, I found it easier to maintain and extend the application. This approach not only improved the codeâ€™s readability but also made debugging and enhancing specific features more manageable.

Additionally, I learned how to **divide large problems into smaller tasks**. By breaking down complex requirements into manageable pieces, I was able to tackle each part systematically and implement solutions more effectively. This practice also extended to my code structure, where I applied modular design principles to ensure each component had a clear, focused responsibility.

The project presented challenges such as integrating the scheduling feature and ensuring reliable email delivery. Overcoming these challenges required careful research, testing, and a deeper understanding of both C# and the libraries used. Each obstacle was an opportunity to refine my skills and apply best practices in software development.
