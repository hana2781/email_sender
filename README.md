# Email Sender Console Application

## Overview

The **Email Sender Console Application** is a C# project designed to explore and learn about C# programming and .NET technologies. This console-based application allows users to send emails with features such as scheduling and attachments.

## Purpose
The **Email Sender Console Application** was inspired by an advanced automated email sending system that I encountered while working with a banking institution in Indonesia. This original system, built using Java, was sophisticated and automated, handling critical communications such as transaction alerts and important notifications seamlessly.

Fascinated by this system's capabilities and driven by a desire to deepen my understanding of C# and .NET technologies, I decided to create a similar application using C#. Unlike the automated system, my console-based application requires manual user input to configure and send emails. This design choice emphasizes hands-on learning and interaction, allowing users to experience email handling in a more direct and controlled manner.

By developing this console application, I aimed to replicate the core concepts and features of the original automated system while exploring the functionalities of C# and .NET. This project not only provided practical experience with email handling, scheduling, and HTML templating but also represented my personal journey in mastering C# and understanding complex email operations.

## Lessons Learned

Building this project provided valuable insights into handling email operations and scheduling tasks programmatically. I gained practical experience with the MailKit library for sending emails, as well as implementing scheduling functionality to manage email delivery times effectively.

A significant lesson learned was the importance of **separation of concerns** in application design. By organizing the code into distinct components for email handling, scheduling, and user interaction, I found it easier to maintain and extend the application. This approach not only improved the codeâ€™s readability but also made debugging and enhancing specific features more manageable.

Additionally, I learned how to **divide large problems into smaller tasks**. By breaking down complex requirements into manageable pieces, I was able to tackle each part systematically and implement solutions more effectively. This practice also extended to my code structure, where I applied modular design principles to ensure each component had a clear, focused responsibility.

The project presented challenges such as integrating the scheduling feature and ensuring reliable email delivery. Overcoming these challenges required careful research, testing, and a deeper understanding of both C# and the libraries used. Each obstacle was an opportunity to refine my skills and apply best practices in software development.
